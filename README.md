- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Seun-works or you can just call me Seun for short. Welcome to my personal self development space.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently a frontend developer using react native but I am well versed in using react, html, css, and typescript..
- Seeing my first project come to life was the moment I realized that becoming a software developer was all I had been looking for. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning aws and all its fundamentals like scripting and networking.
- The projects here are arranged from my first attempts at building a website or a feature, to my later attempts were i have a better understanding of the technologies i use.
