- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Seun-works or you can just call me Seun for short. Welcome to my personal self development space in web development.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning front-end development.
- Seeing my first project come to life was the moment I realized that becoming a software developer was all I had been looking for. 
- I'm also big on learning the intricacies of back-end development so that i can become a full-stack developer in the future.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning react.js and nodeJS
